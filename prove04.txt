1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):
https://cseweek2prove.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/MakenzieHale/cse341-node

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
Everything seems to be functioning correctly. User is able to select a product to see 
it's details, add to cart, order now, and then orders are posted in the orders tab.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Everything functioning correctly.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I think the coolest thing this week was learning about nosql. I've really enjoyed 
learning about that, I feel like the queries are simple to undrestand.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I think I would give updated tips. For example in the videos, Max uses execpopulate, and that wasn't 
needed in my code so it caused errors.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   [4] - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
Everything is functioning the way that it should and application functions.
