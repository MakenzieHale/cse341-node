After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku): 
*Heroku returned application errror*

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
 https://github.com/MakenzieHale/cse341-node

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
All pages are rendered, user is able to submit book names

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
I tried to also have the user enter the price and the description but my code broke 

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest thing I learned with this assignment was pug and handlebars, I like ejs but 
I really enjoyed learning pug and handlebars, I found them to be easier to grasp for me personally
while completing the assignment, but doing it in ejs was doable!

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I would give clearer instructions on how to get the heroku app to work. I got it installed and created, 
but I recieved an application errror when heroku app was opened. Because of this I had to run my code through
node app.js in prove 2.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   [4] - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
My assignment meets the requirements that I followed along with the videos, unfortunately my code
broke when I tried to push the price and description so I had to take that out in order for my code 
to function correctly.
